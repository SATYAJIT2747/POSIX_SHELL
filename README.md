## Project Overview
This project is a custom POSIX shell written in **C++**.  
It works like a basic version of bash, supporting command execution, process control, redirection, piping, and features such as history and autocomplete.  
The full logic is inside the single file **`main.cpp`**, with a **Makefile** for compilation.
